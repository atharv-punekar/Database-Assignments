Q.1] Why is normalization important? What problems occur if a database is not normalized?

     Convert the following unnormalized data into 1NF:

     Order_ID   Customer_Name   Products
     101        Rahul           Laptop, Mouse
     
Answer - 
	Importance Of Normalization -
	-Normalization helps to organize data in structured way.
	-It removes duplication of data.
	-It also prevents insertion, updation and deletion anamolies.
	-Overall it improves consistency of data and reduce storage waste.
	
	Problems if a database is not normalized - 
	-Data redundancy : Same data is stored multiple times, wasting storage space.
	-Data inconsistency: Different values for the same data may exist in the database.
	-Data anomalies: Updating duplicate data can cause inconsistency, inserting data may require missing information, and deleting a record can unintentionally remove important 
	 related data.
	 
	unnormalized data into 1NF -
