Q.1] A query frequently runs:
    
    SELECT * FROM bookings
    WHERE doctor_id = ?
    AND appointment_date >= ?
    AND appointment_date <= ?;

-Propose a composite index
-Explain column order choice.

Answer - 
	Composite Index: CREATE INDEX idx ON bookings (doctor_id, appointment_date)
	Explanation: 
	-The doctor_id column is kept first in the index because the query always searches for a specific doctor using an equality ("=")condition. This helps the 
	database quickly find all records related to that doctor.
	-The appointment_date column is placed next because it is used to filter appointments within a date range("<="), (">="). After selecting the doctor’s records, the database 
	can easily limit the results to the given dates.
	-This order follows the way the query is written and helps improve query performance.
