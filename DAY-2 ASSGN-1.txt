Q.1] Given the table:
      orders
      id | user_id | status | created_at
Q.2] Suggest appropriate indexes
Q.3] Explain why you chose them

Answer - 
	1) Primary Key Index on "id"
	   - PRIMARY KEY (id)
	   Reason - Primary key is unique, not null and identifies each record based on order id, helps for fast retrieval
	   
	2) Index on "user_id"
	   - CREATE INDEX idx ON orders(user_id)
	   Reason - Orders are placed by specific user, so user_id index will enable fast fetching of orders based on user's id
	   
	3) Composite Index on (user_id, created_at)
	   - CREATE INDEX idx ON orders(user_id, created_at)
	   Reason - This index is useful when fetching a user’s orders in chronological order
