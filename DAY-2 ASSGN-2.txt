Q.1] Describe a real-world system where:
     -Soft deletes are required
     -Hard deletes are preferred
     
Answer - 
	1) Soft Delete - A soft delete means the data is not permanently removed from the database, it can be recovered if needed.
	   - Social Media Platform (Instagram):
	   	Here, soft deletes are commonly used for data such as user accounts. When a user deletes their account the data is not removed completely from the database. Instead, 
	   	it is marked as inactive and account can be recovered in 30 days.
	   	
	2) Hard Delete - A hard delete means the data is permanently removed from the database, cannot be recovered.
	   - Chat Application (WhatsApp):
	   	Here, hard deletes are used for temporary or sensitive data like deleted messages, expired media files. When a user permanently deletes a message or when 
	   	media expires, the data is completely removed from the database.
